  /**
   * IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
   * 
   * The direct API approach involves connecting directly to third-party APIs from the frontend
   * code instead of using an intermediate edge function. This pattern is appropriate when:
   * 
   * 1. The API endpoint allows CORS requests from the application domain
   * 2. Authentication tokens are publishable/public and can safely be included in frontend code
   * 3. Reduced latency is important for user experience
   * 4. Simplified deployment and debugging is desired
   * 
   * Case Study: KBAI Integration
   * We transitioned from an edge function-based approach to direct API calls for the KBAI service
   * with the following key components:
   */

  /**
   * DIRECT SERVICE PATTERN
   * 
   * The DirectService pattern follows these principles:
   * 
   * 1. Service Class:
   *    - Encapsulates all API-specific logic in a dedicated class (e.g., KBAIDirectService)
   *    - Maintains the same interface as the edge function-based service for compatibility
   *    - Handles authentication, request formatting, response parsing, error handling, and retries
   * 
   * 2. Interface Compatibility:
   *    - Ensures backward compatibility with existing code by implementing the same methods
   *    - Adapts method names if needed (e.g., checkEdgeFunctionHealth â†’ checkApiHealth + compatibility method)
   *    - Uses the same return types and error patterns
   * 
   * 3. Factory Pattern:
   *    - Uses a factory function (getKBAIService) to abstract the service implementation details
   *    - Allows easy toggling between direct and edge function approaches if needed
   * 
   * 4. Error Handling:
   *    - Implements comprehensive error handling directly in the service
   *    - Provides informative error messages tailored to direct API issues
   *    - Uses fallback data when API connections fail
   */

  /**
   * AUTHENTICATION HANDLING
   * 
   * For APIs requiring authentication:
   * 
   * 1. Only publishable tokens should be included directly in frontend code
   * 2. Private tokens should be stored in environment variables or secrets manager
   * 3. Use appropriate authentication headers with each request
   * 
   * Example for KBAI:
   * ```
   * private readonly KBAI_AUTH_TOKEN = '85abed95769d4b2ea1cb6bfaa8a67193';
   * private readonly KBAI_KB_TOKEN = 'KB00000001_CRPTMONDS';
   * 
   * // Used in request headers
   * private getAuthHeaders(): Record<string, string> {
   *   return {
   *     'Content-Type': 'application/json',
   *     'x-auth-token': this.KBAI_AUTH_TOKEN,
   *     'x-kb-token': this.KBAI_KB_TOKEN
   *   };
   * }
   * ```
   */

  /**
   * CORS CONSIDERATIONS
   * 
   * When implementing direct API calls, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) must be properly handled:
   * 
   * 1. Ensure the API server allows requests from your application domain
   * 2. Handle preflight requests appropriately
   * 3. If CORS issues arise, fallback strategies may include:
   *    - Using a lightweight proxy (if edge functions are available)
   *    - Requesting CORS headers to be added by the API provider
   *    - Using a service-specific SDK if available
   */

  /**
   * ERROR HANDLING AND FALLBACKS
   * 
   * Robust error handling is essential for direct API connections:
   * 
   * 1. Network errors: Handle unreachable services or timeout situations
   * 2. Authentication errors: Handle invalid or expired tokens
   * 3. Service errors: Handle API-specific error responses
   * 4. Provide fallback data when appropriate
   * 
   * Example pattern:
   * ```
   * try {
   *   const isHealthy = await this.checkApiHealth();
   *   if (!isHealthy) {
   *     // Use fallback data
   *     return getFallbackItems();
   *   }
   *   
   *   // Make API call with retry logic
   *   return await this.retryService.executeWithRetry(async () => {
   *     const response = await fetch(this.API_ENDPOINT, requestOptions);
   *     // Process response
   *   });
   * } catch (error) {
   *   // Log error, notify user, use fallback data
   *   return getFallbackItems();
   * }
   * ```
   */

  /**
   * BENEFITS OF DIRECT API APPROACH
   * 
   * 1. Simplified Architecture:
   *    - Eliminates an intermediate layer (edge function)
   *    - Reduces deployment complexity
   *    - Simplifies local development and testing
   * 
   * 2. Performance Benefits:
   *    - Reduces latency by making direct API calls
   *    - Eliminates cold start issues with serverless functions
   * 
   * 3. Debugging Benefits:
   *    - More transparent error handling
   *    - Direct visibility into API responses
   *    - Easier to debug in browser developer tools
   * 
   * 4. Deployment Benefits:
   *    - No need to deploy and maintain edge functions
   *    - Fewer potential points of failure
   * 
   * 5. Cost Benefits:
   *    - Eliminates serverless function execution costs
   *    - Reduces data transfer costs through intermediaries

  /**
   * LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS
   * 
   * Direct API approach may not be suitable in all cases:
   * 
   * 1. Security Limitations:
   *    - Not suitable for APIs requiring private credentials
   *    - Exposes API endpoints and publishable tokens in client code
   * 
   * 2. CORS Limitations:
   *    - Only works with APIs that support CORS for your domain
   *    - May require additional configuration on the API side
   * 
   * 3. Rate Limiting Considerations:
   *    - Client-side rate limiting may be needed
   *    - IP-based rate limits apply to end users rather than your server
   * 
   * 4. Transformation Limitations:
   *    - Complex data transformations may be better handled server-side
   *    - Large responses may impact client performance

/**
 * RESTORING EARLIER VERSIONS
 * 
 * To restore the edge function-based approach:
 * 
 * 1. In src/integrations/kbai/index.ts:
 *    - Modify the getKBAIService factory function to return KBAIMCPService instead of KBAIDirectService
 *    - Update relevant import statements if needed
 * 
 * 2. The legacy edge function code is preserved in:
 *    - KBAIMCPService.ts
 *    - KBAIConnector.ts
 *    - supabase/functions/kbai-connector/index.ts
 * 
 * 3. Deployment Requirements:
 *    - Ensure the kbai-connector edge function is deployed to Supabase
 *    - Update any environment variables or secrets needed by the edge function

/**
 * TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
 * 
 * Common issues and solutions:
 * 
 * 1. API Connection Failures
 *    - Check network connectivity
 *    - Verify API endpoint URLs
 *    - Check authentication tokens
 *    - Look for CORS errors in browser console
 * 
 * 2. Authentication Issues
 *    - Verify token validity and expiration
 *    - Check token formatting in request headers
 * 
 * 3. CORS Errors
 *    - Check API documentation for CORS support
 *    - Verify allowed origins configuration
 *    - Consider using a proxy if CORS cannot be resolved
 * 
 * 4. Response Parsing Errors
 *    - Log raw responses for debugging
 *    - Ensure response format matches expected schema
 *    - Add more robust error handling around parsing
